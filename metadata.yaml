description: "The Moon Pool is a fantasy novel by Abraham Merritt (1884–1943). It\
  \ originally appeared as two short stories in All-Story Weekly: \"The Moon Pool\"\
  \ (1918) and its sequel, \"Conquest of the Moon Pool\" (1919). These were then reworked\
  \ into a novel released in 1919. The protagonist, Dr. Goodwin, would later appear\
  \ in Merritt's second novel The Metal Monster (1920).\nAlthough Merritt did not\
  \ invent the \"lost world\" novel—he followed in the footsteps of Bulwer-Lytton,\
  \ Conan Doyle, Burroughs, and others—this work extended the tradition.\n From Wikipedia\
